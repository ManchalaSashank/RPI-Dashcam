#  Raspberry Pi Dashcam – IoT-Based Smart Surveillance & Crash Detection System

This project implements a smart, Iot based, low-cost **Dashcam system using Raspberry Pi**. It continuously records video, detects crashes using a vibration sensor (SW-420), and sends alert emails with video footage upon impact. Designed for vehicles, this solution is ideal for personal use, fleet monitoring, or DIY IoT setups.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Build a complete Iot based Raspberry Pi-based dashcam system that continuously records video, detects vibrations (accidents), and automatically alerts the user via email with a timestamp and video attachment.

---

## 🛠️ Features Implemented

-  **Continuous Video Recording** (1280x720 @ 30fps using `Picamera2`)
-  **Storage to USB Drive** (organized by date, plug-and-play)
-  **Crash Detection** (via SW-420 vibration sensor and GPIO)
-  **Alert Notification** via Email with the attached crash video
-  **Auto Start on Boot** using `systemd` services
-  **Timestamps** for file naming and email body
-  Power-on → Record → Detect → Alert (No human intervention)
